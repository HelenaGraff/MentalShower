      Hi {{firstName}}! 
      <br>
      Our app is meant to provide you with the best possible experience while attending your classes at Zealand Academy. 
      <br>
      This goal is achieved by you being able to influence the indoor climate in a class room, according to your own definition of comfort. 
     <br>
      On the next page, we want to shortly present to you the four parameters on which the quality of your activities is depending directly.
      <br>
      Feel free to access all of these benefits and control the indoor climate in <b>Mood</b>.
